# Basketball Analyst (No‑Code Starter)
A Streamlit web app to upload basketball game footage, mark events (shots/possessions), and export highlight clips + a CSV — **no coding required**.


## Quick Deploy (Streamlit Cloud)
1) Create a **public** GitHub repo and add the files from this folder.
2) Go to https://streamlit.io → Sign in → **Deploy an app**.
3) Select your repo, set **file path** to `app.py`, and click **Deploy**.


### Local Run (optional)
- Install Python 3.11+.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `streamlit run app.py`


### Tips
- Keep individual clips ~4–10 seconds for fast export.
- If uploads fail, try a smaller video (e.g., 720p) or split halves.
